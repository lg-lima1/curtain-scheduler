# Curtain Scheduler
Project developed for the final exam on Electrical Engineering: Practical Applications course.

Enables any curtain to have scheduled open and close times. This is possible due to the stepper motor, that can be in any size, and an RTC module, that is responsible for enabling RTC capability on the Arduino. Last but not least, all the code was developed for the Arduino board using a few libraries.

# Hardware
  - Arduino (Uno or Mega)
  - Stepper Motor and Driver
  - 16x2 LCD Display
  - RTC Module
  - Periphery (buttons, power supply and a switch)
